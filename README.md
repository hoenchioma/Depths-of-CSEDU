# Depths-of-CSEDU
CSE-1211 Lab Project (Fall 2018)

## Outline
This is an academic group project of the course CSE-1211 for 1st year 2nd semester in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Univeristy of Dhaka.

## Members
1. Raheeb Hassan (Roll: AE-42)
2. Farhan Kabir (Roll: AE-12)

## Abstract/Summary
The project is an adventure based top view role playing game.
The game is a slightly different take on the classic adventure role playing games. The premise, the main character played as a university student gets trapped within the compounds of his university. While trying to escape, he soon discovers that his department isnâ€™t the same at night. There are locked rooms and unknown stairways which lead to the depths of the building. Now, he must cross it all and escape. The player would have to wander and find "keys". Often, in order to unlock keys there will be puzzles and enemies to defeat. Each key unlocks a new region. Coins are scattered around the map which can be used to gain special abilities and discover hidden secrets. If all the keys are collected and the final level is completed, the player can leave the department premises. Or, he can replay all the levels again.


## Prerequisites
### Libraries
1. [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) 2.5.0 ([download](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.0/))
<br> (SFML 2.4.2 is sufficient for building on Linux)
2. [TGUI](https://tgui.eu/) 0.8 ([download](https://tgui.eu/download/))

### Setting up on Windows

##### SFML
1. Download the precompiled library files of SFML 2.5.0 for Visual Studio 2017 (32 bit) and place in desired folder.
2. In Visual Studio open Project > Properties > C/C++ > Additional include libraries and add the path to the `/include` folder of the SFML library here.
3. Again in Project > Properties, goto Linker > General and add the path to the `/lib` folder of the SFML library to the Additional Library Directories option.
4. Finally in Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies add the following to the front of the line separated by a semi-colon
```
sfml-graphics.lib;sfml-window.lib;sfml-system.lib;sfml-network.lib;sfml-audio.lib;
```
5. Copy paste the .dll files from the /lib folder to the project folder or the system32 folder of the PC

##### TGUI
1. Download the precompiled library files of TGUI 0.8 for Visual Studio 2017 and place in desired folder.
2. In Visual Studio open Project > Properties > C/C++ > Additional include libraries and add the path to the `/include` folder of the TGUI library here.
3. Again in Project > Properties, goto Linker > General and add the path to the `/lib` folder of the TGUI library to the Additional Library Directories option.
4. Finally in Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies add the following ** after the SFML libraries ** `tgui.lib`. It should look something like this afterwards.
```
sfml-graphics.lib;sfml-window.lib;sfml-system.lib;sfml-network.lib;sfml-audio.lib;tgui.lib;....
```
5. Copy paste the .dll files from the /lib folder to the project folder or the system32 folder of the PC

#### CMake
If using CMake to build, set the `SFML_DIR_R` && `TGUI_DIR_R` to the SFML and TGUI directories respectively in CMakeLists.txt.


### Setting up on Linux

#### Ubuntu/Debian
For installing SFML and TGUI execute the following commands on a terminal
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
(Ubuntu 15.10 or higher)
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:texus/tgui-0.7
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libtgui-dev
```
Alternatively, you can build the libraries from source (for compatibility issues or latest version). Related instructions can be found on library websites.

#### Others
For others you have to build the libraries from source. Related instructions can be found [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/compile-with-cmake.php) and [here](https://tgui.eu/tutorials/0.8/linux/).

**Caution:** When building from source make sure the versions of SFML and TGUI are compatible.

## Building
### Windows
You can use the given Visual Studio Project file or generate your own using the `CMakeLists.txt`

If using CMake, make sure to set the `SFML_DIR_R` && `TGUI_DIR_R` to the SFML and TGUI directories respectively in CMakeLists.txt.

**Note:** If having issues running the executable make sure all the `.dll` files are in the folder where the executable file is (`.exe`). You can also try copying the resource folders (`res`, `save` & `extra`) to the said folder if it is still causing issues.

### Linux
For building on linux execute the following from the source directory (the directory with CMakeLists.txt)
```
mkdir bin && cd bin/
cmake ..
make
```
**Note:** You have to execute the binary `Somber` from the source directory as the resource folders are located there.
```
cd ..
./bin/Somber
```
Alternatively you can copy the resource folders (`res`, `save` & `extra`) to the `bin` folder.
